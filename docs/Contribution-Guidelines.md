Reference code of conduct.

## GitHub Workflow

## Environments

We are also actively open to adding community contributed environments as 
examples, as long as they are small, simple, demonstrate a unique feature of 
the platform, and provide a unique non-trivial challenge to modern 
machine learning algorithms. Feel free to submit these environments with a
Pull-Request explaining the nature of the environment and task.
